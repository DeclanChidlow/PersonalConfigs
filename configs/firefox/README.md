I don't use Firefox but rather a fork called [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net). That said, when using any Firefox based browser I find is very beneficial to do some tweaks.

I usually disable Kinetic scrolling due to it seeming inaccurate. It can be disabled by opening ```about:config``` and setting ```apz.gtk.kinetic_scroll.enabled``` to ```false```.

I use the Mocha Mauve [Catppuccin Firefox theme](https://github.com/catppuccin/firefox) as well.

If using Firefox on Wayland I set ```MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1```. This improves performance and removes potential fuzziness.
